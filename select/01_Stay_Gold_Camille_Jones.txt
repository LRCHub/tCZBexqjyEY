There's something strange in the way
You hold my hand tonight
It's like the walls are closing in
It feels so wrong

Afraid to loose, afraid to love
Afraid to catch your eyes
But I have the hope to keep us close
To keep us on

Hold on but don't speak
Words won't kill the pain
Stay gold with me
Let's fall in love again

Hold on but don't cry
Cause there's no other way
Stay gold you and I
We'll fall in love again

There's something strange in the way
You look into my eyes
I hate to see that you're not okay with me

You're holding back holding on won't let it go no
But don't give up don't give in
Just be strong – hold on

Hold on

Hold on but don't speak
Words won't kill the pain
Stay gold with me
Let's fall in love again

Hold on but don't cry
Cause there's no other way
Stay gold you and I
We'll fall in love again

Hold on

There's something strange in the way
You say my name tonight
I hear the sadness in your voice

Afraid to loose afraid, to love
Afraid to catch your eyes
But I have the hope to keep us close
To keep us on, so

So hold on but don't speak
Words won't kill the pain
Stay gold with me
Let's fall in love again

So hold on but don't cry
Cause there's no other way
Stay gold you and I
We'll fall in love again

Hold on

Hold on
Stay gold
Hold on
Stay gold

Hold on but don't speak
Words won't kill the pain
Stay gold with me
Let's fall in love again

Hold on but don't cry
Cause there's no other way
Stay gold you and I
We'll fall in love again
