Seize upon that moment, long ago
One breath away, and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time
So gold

Still, away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever, and be in time
Stay gold

But can it be
When we can see so vividly a memory?
And yes, you say, so must the day
Too fade away, and leave a ray of sun
So gold

Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined, all things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold, gold, gold
Though gold
