Some places fall through spaces
Empty into the weight of anything, my love
If we should fly away
But we will someday

I look into the ocean
And that the big blue ocean always changing
Never stays the same
Whispering my name

I'll always be there for you
Where as constant as the sun
Until it burns down slowly
No matter what we've ever done

Still trees are firmly planted
While our views of life are granted
Only to the ones who gone aways
Til the break of day

I'll always be there for you
Where as constant as the sun
Until it burns down slowly
No matter what we've ever done

The stars are always shining
While the world is sadly planning
For something so meaningless and small
Who would let them fall

I'll always be there for you
Where as constant as the sun
Until it burns down slowly
No matter what we've ever done

You'll always stand there
When they melt into the sun
Your eyes have seen the sunlight
